# Dollar_cost_averaging
This repository aims to find out the best dollar cost averaging investment frequencies among daily, weekly, and monthly if invest X into QQQ within a year to maximise the total return. 

To find out the best dollar cost averaging frequency if one wants to invest X dollar say USD10,000 into QQQ within a year, say starting from year Jan 2016 to Dec 2016, what dollar cost averaging frequency is the best, daily, weekly or monthly. 

The good point about dollar cost averaging is when QQQ price is high, the same dollar amount buys less number of shares at high price. and the same dollar amount buys more shares when QQQ price is low. This solve the problem of timing the market. 

One may also worry how if he/she started investing not at a good starting year. Therefore, I repeat the study for starting the investing from different years. Can you guys guess 
1. what is the best dollar cost averaging frequency &
2. what is the best starting year
for a good average annual return or total return ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜¬ðŸ¤«?
