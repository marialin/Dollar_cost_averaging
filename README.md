# Dollar_Cost_Averaging

This repository aims to determine the best dollar-cost averaging (DCA) investment frequencyâ€”daily, weekly, or monthlyâ€”when investing a fixed amount into QQQ within a year, in order to maximize total returns.

To explore this, we analyze the performance of investing a fixed amount (e.g., USD 10,000) into QQQ over the course of a yearâ€”for example, from January 2016 to December 2016â€”using different DCA frequencies: daily, weekly, and monthly.

The advantage of dollar-cost averaging is that when QQQâ€™s price is high, the same dollar amount buys fewer shares, and when the price is low, it buys more shares. This approach helps mitigate the risks of market timing.

But what if the starting year is not ideal? To address this concern, the study is repeated across different starting years to observe the impact on returns.

Can you guess:

1. Which dollar-cost averaging frequency performs best?
2. Which starting year delivers the best average annual or total return? ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜¬ðŸ¤«
